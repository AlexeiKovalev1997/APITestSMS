The tests were written using the frameworks: Cucumber, Cypress; programming languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Gherkin. 

Tests use my account data, but the tests are also written from the perspective of a test user who does not have an "Insufficient Balance" problem. 
Thus, various valid and invalid data sending scenarios are taken into account.
